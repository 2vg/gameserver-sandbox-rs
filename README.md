# gameserver-sandbox-rs

This is a sandbox repository that implements a very small game server using [actix](https://github.com/actix/actix-web) and embedded DB [sled](https://github.com/spacejam/sled).

This was inspired by [Game Server in 150 lines of Rust](https://medium.com/@buterajay/game-server-in-150-lines-of-rust-ce1782199907).

It is also based on the DDD architecture.

Cuz a very simple implementation, an Entity has only a unique ID and position data.

However, cuz the DDD architecture,  so probably easily extensible.
